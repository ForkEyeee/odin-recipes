    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Toast is sliced bread that has been browned by radiant heat. 
        The browning is the result of a Maillard reaction altering the flavor of the bread and making it firmer.</p>
    <p>The firm surface is easier to spread toppings on and the warmth can help butter reach its melting point.</p>
